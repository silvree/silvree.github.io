		<h3>Problem</h3>
		<p><br>Before starting my job in September 2018 as a Digital Designer at Maple Leaf Foods, I was given a small design challenge as a warm-up. The purpose of this was to become acquainted with the company's branding and style, and I was told to use their main website as a guideline.<br><br>The challenge was simple: create a small mockup of a tablet app that users could log into for searching and applying to job openings at the company.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>Process</h3>
		<p><br>The first step was to familiarize myself with Maple Leaf's main website and take note of any existing layouts that could be useful in designing the mockup. Drawing inspiration from this, I began sketching out various ideas for the required screens, as well as starting to build reusable componets for the interfaces. For this challenge, I decided to use Figma.<br><br>The final tablet designs can be seen below:</p>

				<img src="assets/mapleleafcareers-tablet1.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Maple Leaf Careers - tablet login">
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-3">
				<img src="assets/mapleleafcareers-tablet2.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Maple Leaf Careers - tablet list view">
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-3">
				<img src="assets/mapleleafcareers-tablet3.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Maple Leaf Careers - tablet detail view">
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-3">
				<img src="assets/mapleleafcareers-tablet4.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Maple Leaf Careers - tablet application form">
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<p><br>While not in the initial challenge, I also came up with a desktop version:</p>
		<br>
		
		<div class="container-fluid alternate">
			<div class="col-sm-3">
				<img src="assets/mapleleafcareers-desktop1.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Maple Leaf Careers - desktop login">
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-3">
				<img src="assets/mapleleafcareers-desktop2.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Maple Leaf Careers - desktop list view">
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-3">
				<img src="assets/mapleleafcareers-desktop3.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Maple Leaf Careers - desktop detail view">
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-3">
				<img src="assets/mapleleafcareers-desktop4.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Maple Leaf Careers - desktop application form">
			</div>
		</div>
	
		<h3>Next Steps</h3>
		<p><br>While I am mostly happy with how this challenge turned out, there are some things I would have liked to do differently. For example, I would move the navigation bar from top to bottom on the tablet version, as users may find it easier to reach. It would have also been nice if I could test out the tablet version on a real tablet to truly get a feel for scale and what the user would experience.</p>
