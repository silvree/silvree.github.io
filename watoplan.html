		<h3>Problem</h3>
		<p><br>&emsp;&emsp;My design journey started in the design course of the fall 2017 term, SYDE 161. We were put into groups of 6 and given a prompt: design something to improve health and wellness for upper year undergraduate students. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;University students from a variety of years often face mental health problems and stress due to their classes and course load. By interviewing some upper year undergraduates, we found that feeling overwhelmed by tasks is a large contributing factor to this problem, which is why our group decided to focus on time management and task notification. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Existing solutions were physical and digital planners and task-tracking apps. Each of these had downsides; for example, 56% of our survey respondents said they often forgot their time management aid when needed. Paper planners, although customizable, could easily get lost or damaged. Task-tracking apps lacked the ability to create events on a calendar, and planner apps weren't as good at creating specific tasks.</p>

		<h3>Design Process</h3>
		<p><br>&emsp;&emsp;After analyzing the problem and conducting the user surveys, we came up with some user personas and low fidelity prototypes. With more feedback on our initial designs, we settled on a solution, which we later named "WaToPlan", incorporating both physical and digital aspects. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;The idea consisted of multiple notification "beacons", attachable by various means, all controlled by a central phone application. The beacons can be attached to a variety objects that the user deems important, such as backpacks, textbooks, and notebooks. LEDs and speakers on the beacons notify users of upcoming tasks and events, with each individual beacon able to provide notifications for different task groups or types. Beacon options and task entries are made on the accompanying app, allowing for a customizable experience tailored to user needs. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;However, before getting too invested in this idea, we conducted a set of user tests. One of these tests was concerning the app layout and how easy it was to figure out how to use. At that stage, we didn't have an app ready to test - this is where mockups came in. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;I was in charge of creating one for the test. At the time, I didn't know of tools like Figma and Invision, so I used PowerPoint to simulate a "fake app", focusing on the layout but also including some functional buttons.</p>
