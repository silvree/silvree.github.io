		<p><br>My design journey started in the design course of the fall 2017 term, SYDE 161. We were put into groups of 6 and given a prompt: design something to improve health and wellness for upper year undergraduate students.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>Problem</h3>
		<p><br>University students from a variety of years often face mental health problems and stress due to their classes and course load. By interviewing some upper year undergraduates, we found that feeling overwhelmed by tasks is a large contributing factor to this problem, which is why our group decided to focus on time management and task notification. </p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
		<p><br>Existing solutions were physical and digital planners and task-tracking apps. Each of these had downsides; for example, 56% of our survey respondents said they often forgot their time management aid when needed. Paper planners, although customizable, could easily get lost or damaged. Task-tracking apps lacked the ability to create events on a calendar, and planner apps weren't as good at creating specific tasks.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Solution Overview</h3>
		<p><br>After analyzing the problem and conducting the user surveys, we came up with some user personas and low fidelity prototypes. With more feedback on our initial designs, we settled on a solution, which we later named "WaToPlan", incorporating both physical and digital aspects. <br><br>The idea consisted of multiple notification "beacons", attachable by various means, all controlled by a central phone application. The beacons can be attached to a variety objects that the user deems important, such as backpacks, textbooks, and notebooks. LEDs and speakers on the beacons notify users of upcoming tasks and events, with each individual beacon able to provide notifications for different task groups or types. Beacon options and task entries are made on the accompanying app, allowing for a customizable experience tailored to user needs. </p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>Prototype and User Testing</h3>
		<p><br>To validate our design choice and seek improvements, we conducted a set of user tests. One of these tests was concerning the app layout and how easy it was to figure out how to use. At that stage, we didn't have an app ready to test - this is where prototyping came in. <br><br>I was in charge of creating one for the test. At the time, I didn't know of tools like Figma and Invision, so I used PowerPoint to simulate an app interface, focusing on the layout but also including some functional buttons. The main goal of this mockup was to recreate the process of adding a new event.</p>

		<p><br>As seen above, the prototype consisted of four main views of the app: a daily, weekly, and monthy task view as well as the "New Task" screen. Users began at the daily task view and were told to create a new task. Most users quickly knew to press the "+" button and proceed from there, though one user switched to the calendar view and tried clicking on a date. We took note of this and planned to include a similar method of adding tasks into our final design. </p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p><br>We then began programming the Android app for our high fidelity prototype. The physical beacons were modeled and 3D printed, and had an Arduino prototype circuit wired up. However, as this was a course project, there wasn't enough time to fully complete the solution. If given the time, we would have liked to conduct more user tests while developing the design, to ensure that we were on track and that it met their needs.<br><br>After this experience and introduction to the world of design, I started looking into better prototyping methods, as I saw how important it was to rapidly produce and test prototypes during the development of a solution. </p>
